# movieRecomenderSystem

this exercise makes an intensive use of STL.
it gets 2 input text files 
1) names of movies followed by a ranking of how <genre> they are. (for example: how comic, how horror...P)
2) names of users and their score for several of the movies (not all of them so we can make a recommendation)

The system will either recommend a movie for a specified users or predict their score for it.
In order to use the library, write a file with a main() function
